# Getting Started - Features

## What are Features

A feature is a collection of operations and objects which create something we call a feature. For example:

* A Cube is a feature.
* Our axis datum is a feature.
* An extrude is a feature.
* A sketch is a feature.

But do not mix these up with Bodies.

## Useful Functions

Features are a powerful and well used part of the NXOpen API. So it's important to know what they are.
