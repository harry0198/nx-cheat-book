# ðŸ”§ NX & NXOpen Cheat Sheet

## About

Author: Harry Drummond Email: Harry.Drummond@mayahtt.com

Currently on placement at MayaHTT having never touched NX and as a result, never touched NXOpen.

If you're unclear NX is the program we do modelling on etc. NXOpen is the API to that program.

## Useful Resources

### Help Sites

* [Siemens Community NX Customization and Programming](https://www.dmu.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate-courses/computer-science-bsc-degree/computer-science-bsc-degree.aspx#structure\_and\_assesment): Don't neglect this site, it is active and a lot of the time your issue has already been raised and solved here.
* [Eng-Tips NX Forum](https://www.eng-tips.com/threadminder.cfm?pid=561): If you can ignore the hideous website design, there are some very knowledgeable people on here.
* [NXJournaling](https://nxjournaling.com/): Primarily Visual Basic code. Answers will almost always be an NX Journal response to a question.

### Documentation

* [Python docs](https://docs.plm.automation.siemens.com/data\_services/resources/nx/1926/nx\_api/custom/en\_US/nxopen\_python\_ref/namespaces.html): You should view this as a sort of "new" version of the docs. Often, you will find lazy docs and it will be a link to the old version of the docs.
* [.NET docs](https://docs.plm.automation.siemens.com/data\_services/resources/nx/1847/nx\_api/custom/en\_US/nxopen\_net/classes.html): Essentially the "old" docs but here will generally have a more thorough explanation of a function or class.
* [Siemens Doc Center](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/support/docs.html): Personally, I've never used it but if some function has mysteriously gone missing - this will show you what happened to it.

### Useful NX Utilities

* Journaling: If you know how to do something in NX but not in code. Record a journal and extract the features you need.
* UF Session: Holds useful information on objects such as finding face normals, vectors etc

## Want to deep dive?

Dive a little deeper and start exploring our API reference to get an idea of everything that's possible with the API:
